# Because all the files in the "lib" directory are included as "lib/file.js" it
# means "lib" must be in NODE_PATH, however modifying the global NODE_PATH
# variable would be messy. So instead, the path is set temporarily just before running
# the app. To do this, this bash wrapper is needed (also a messy solution, but node
# path resolution is messy anyway). See https://gist.github.com/branneman/8048520
