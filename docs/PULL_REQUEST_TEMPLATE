# Adding new features

If you want to add a new feature, consider asking about it before implementing it to
make sure it is within the scope of the project. Of course you are free to create the
pull request directly but it is not guaranteed it is going to be accepted.

# Style

- Only use tabs for indentation, not spaces.
- Do not remove or add optional characters from other lines (such as colons or new line
  characters) as it can make the commit needlessly big, and create conflicts with other
  changes.
