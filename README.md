# Joplin

<!-- [SCREENSHOTS] -->

Joplin is a free, open source note taking and todo application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified with your own text editor. The Android application supports markdown rendering.

The notes can be synchronised with various targets including the file system (for example with a network directory) or with Microsoft OneDrive. When synchronising the notes, notebooks, tags and other metadata are saved to plain text files which can be easily inspected, backed up and moved around.

Notes exported from Evenotes via .enex files can be imported into Joplin, including the formatted content (which is converted to markdown), resources (images, attachments, etc.) and complete metadata (geolocation, updated time, created time, etc.).

The current release has been heavily tested so it should be stable enough for every day use. Some features however are missing such as the ability to attach resources to notes and (in the mobile app) to tag notes. For the full list of current and planned features see the Features and Roadmap sections below.

# Install

An Android app and a command line interface are currently available. Both can synchronise with each others.

# Features

- Mobile and command line applications.
- Support notes, todos, tags and notebooks.
- Offline first, so the entire data is always available on the device.
- Ability to synchronise with multiple targets, including the file system and OneDrive (Dropbox is planned).
- Synchronises to a plain text format, which can be easily manipulated, backed up, or exported to a different format.
- Plain text notes, which are rendered as markdown in the mobile application.
- Tag support (currently, tags can be imported from Evernote and modified in the CLI application, but not yet in the mobile one)
- File attachment support (likewise, all file attachements can be imported from Evernote but currently cannot be manually added to a note)
- Search functionality.
- Geolocation support.
- Supports multiple languages.

# Localisation

The applications are currently available in English and French. If you would like to contribute a translation it is quite straightforward, please follow these steps:

- Download Poedit, the translation editor, and install it: https://poedit.net/
- Download the file to be translated: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/master/CliClient/locales/joplin.pot
- In Poedit, open this .pot file, go into the Catalog menu and click Configuration. Change "Country" and "Language" to your own country and language.
- From then you can translate the file. Once it's done, please send the file to [this address](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/laurent22/joplin/master/Assets/Adresse.png).

# Roadmap

- All clients: End to end encryption.
- All clients: Support for Dropbox synchronisation.
- Mobile: Compile Windows app?
- Mobile: Support for dark theme / light theme.
- Mobile: Link for non-image resources.
- Mobile: Handle tags.
- Mobile: Markdown edition support
- CLI: Option to open conflicts with diff program.
- CLI: Link to open resources (images, attached files, etc).

# Command line usage

Joplin can work either as an interactive CLI application or, if a command is provided to the executable, as a one-off command.

For example, this would start the CLI application, from where commands can be ran interactively.

    joplin

While this would create a new note and exit:

    joplin mknote "my new note"

## Full commands:

    cat <title>

        Displays the given note.

        -v, --verbose  Displays the complete information about note.

    config [name] [value]

        the value of [name]. If neither [name] nor [value] is provided, it 
        will list the current configuration.

        -v, --verbose  Also displays hidden config variables.

    cp <pattern> [notebook]

        Duplicates the notes matching <pattern> to [notebook]. If no notebook 
        is specified the note is duplicated in the current notebook.

    geoloc <title>

        Displays a geolocation URL for the note.

    import-enex <file> [notebook]

                               or `nt` for notes and todos (eg. `-tt` would
