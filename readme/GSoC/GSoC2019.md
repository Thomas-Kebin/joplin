2020 is Joplin first round at Google Summer of Code, so excuse some incompleteness here.  
Detailed information on how to get involved and apply are given in the general Summer of Code introduction. 

**These are all proposals! We are open to new ideas you might have!!** Do you have an awesome idea you want to work on with Joplin but that is not among the ideas below? That's cool. We love that! But please do us a favor: Get in touch with a mentor early on and make sure your project is realistic and within the scope of Joplin.

### Information for Students

These ideas were contributed by our developers and users. They are sometimes vague or incomplete. If you wish to submit a proposal based on these ideas, you are urged to contact the developers and find out more about the particular suggestion you're looking at.

Becoming accepted as a Google Summer of Code student is quite competitive. Accepted students typically have thoroughly researched the technologies of their proposed project and have been in frequent contact with potential mentors. **Simply copying and pasting an idea here will not work.** On the other hand, creating a completely new idea without first consulting potential mentors rarely works.
