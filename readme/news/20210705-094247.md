# Any ideas for a Joplin tagline?

I'm going to update the website front page to better showcase the application. I have most of the sections right, but the part I'm still not sure about is the top tagline, so I'm wondering if anyone had any suggestion about it?

From what I can see on Google Keep or Evernote for example it should be something like "Use our app to get X or Y benefit", it should be a sentence that directly speaks to the user essentially.

So far I have "Your notes, anywhere you are" but I'm not certain that's particularly inspiring. Any other idea about what tagline could be used?
