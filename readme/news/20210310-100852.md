# Joplin has been accepted for Google Summer of Code 2021!

For the second year, Joplin [has been accepted as an organisation](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6579646541332480/) for GSoC 2021. This is great news and we look forward to start working with students and discuss project ideas. We should see some nice new features and improvements on the project again this year.
