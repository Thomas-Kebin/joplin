# New Joplin icon, second round

 The quest for a [new Joplin icon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/new-icon-for-30218482)  continue - first many thanks for the votes and feedback! It definitely  helped getting a better sense of what would make a great icon.

Taking all this into account, the remaining candidates are the 5  following icons. The first three were the top voted icons, and the  following two are based on the feedback here and on the forum.

Again that would be great if you could vote for your top 2 icons. I  expect the winner among these will be the next Joplin icon. Also of  course general feedback is welcome too!
