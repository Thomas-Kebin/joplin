# New config screen design is ready!

The design put the menu bar on the left, which I think makes sense, as it's consistent with the main screen UI. And I expect this bar will be the same colour as the main screen sidebar

For checkboxes Serj used a toggle button, which actually makes it easier to align all the labels on the left (a checkbox with a label on the left looks strange) so I might go with it.

Otherwise the screens are relatively similar but tidier. If you have any suggestion on what could be changed, feel free to let me know.
