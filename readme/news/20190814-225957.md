# Joplin now supports Fountain screenwriting markup language

[Fountain](https://fountain.io/) is markup language for screenwriting. Similar to Markdown, it is a lightweight markup format, which allows editing screenplays in plain text.

The desktop and mobile Joplin applications now support Fountain, allowing you to write and read your screenplays on your computer or on the go. To add a Fountain screenplay to a note simply wrap it into a fenced block, with the "fountain" identifier. For example:

```fountain

\*\*FADE IN:\*\*

A RIVER.

We're underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along. Â 

```

For example, here is Big Fish on mobile:
