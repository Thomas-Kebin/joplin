# New pre-release coming soon

Now that the GSoC changes have been merged and the application made more stable following the rewrite of the note editor code, a new pre-release will be available soon.

It will include several important features, which I will describe into more details in following posts, but for information the main new features will be:

\- Allow editing note attachments and syncing the changes

\- Save sensitive settings such as passwords to the system keychain

\- Allow changing the app appearance according to the system theme

\- Allow manually ordering notes

\- A new text editor, Code Mirror, will be available for beta-testing
