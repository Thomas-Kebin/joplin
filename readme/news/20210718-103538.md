# The Jopin Cloud beta is now closed

The beta program helped narrow down a few issues and should make Joplin Cloud (and Joplin Server) more reliable. More precisely:

- About 7 bugs have been fixed, including two major ones regarding sharing, and one security issue.
    
- About a dozen improvements, new features and optimisations have been added following your feedback.

As promised if you have a beta account you can keep using it and it will remain free for the three months after the account was created. After that, you will receive a link to start the Stripe subscription if you wish to keep using the account.

If you have sent me an email before the end of the beta and I didn't reply yet, I will do so soon, and will send you the confirmation email.

Thanks everyone for participating!
