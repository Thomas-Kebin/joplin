Still more fixes and improvements to get v1 as stable as possible before adding new features.

IMPORTANT: If you use Nextcloud it is recommended to sync all your notes before installing this release (see below).

- Fixed: Nextcloud sync target ID (which was incorrectly set to WebDAV sync ID). As a result items that have been created since this bug will be re-synced with Nextcloud. This sync will not duplicate or delete any item but is necessary to preserve data integrity. IF YOU HAVE NOTES IN CONFLICT AFTER SYNC: Close the app completely and restart it to make sure all the lists are visually up-to-date. The notes in conflict most likely can be ignored - they are just duplicate of the real ones. To be safe, check the content but most likely they can simply be deleted.
- Improved: Provide Content-Length header for WebDAV for better compatibility with more servers
- Fixed: Allow copy and paste from config and encryption screen on macOS
- Fixed: [#201](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/201), [#216](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/216): Make sure only one update check can run at a time, and improved modal dialog boxes
