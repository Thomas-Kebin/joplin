# Joplin changelog

## [v1.4.19](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/tag/v1.4.19) - 2020-12-01T11:11:16Z

- Improved: Disable soft-break by default in Markdown rendering

Although soft-break is part of the CommonMark spec, it requires a special editor that can wrap text at a certain limit. That doesn't make much sense in Joplin, where the editor can have various sizes, from desktop to mobile, and where the tools to wrap text are not present.

## [v1.4.18](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/tag/v1.4.18) - 2020-11-28T12:21:41Z

- Fixed: Fixed notifications on macOS
- Fixed: Re-enabled ASAR packing to improve startup time

## [v1.4.16](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/tag/v1.4.16) - 2020-11-27T19:40:16Z

- Fixed: Fix sorting by title in a case insensitive way
- Fixed: Fixed spell checker crash when no language is selected

## [v1.4.15](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/tag/v1.4.15) - 2020-11-27T13:25:43Z

- Fixed: Notifications on macOS
- Fixed: Fixed potential crash when watching note files or resources
- Fixed: Prevents crash when invalid spell checker language is selected, and provide fallback for invalid language codes ([#4146](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/4146))
- Plugins: Fixed webview postMessage call

## [v1.4.12](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/tag/v1.4.12) - 2020-11-23T18:58:07Z

**Breaking Changes:**

- If you use the Clipper API, please note that there are a few breaking changes in this version. See this link for more information: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/pull/3983
- Plugins: `joplin.views.dialogs.open()` now returns an object instead of the button ID that was clicked. So for example instead of getting just `"ok"`, you will get `{ "id": "ok" }`. This is to allow adding form data to that object.

**Deprecated:**

The following features are deprecated. It will still work for now but please update your code:

- Plugins: All `create()` functions under `joplin.views` now take a `viewId` as a first parameter.
- Plugins: `MenuItemLocation.Context` is deprecated and is now an alias for `MenuItemLocation.NoteListContextMenu`
- Plugins: The `app_min_version` manifest property is now required. If not provided it will assume v14.
- Plugins: The `id` manifest property is now required. If not set, it will be the plugin filename or directory.

Plugin doc has been updated with some info about the [development process](https://joplinapp.org/api/references/plugin_api/classes/joplin.html).

## [v1.0.245](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/tag/v1.0.245) - 2020-09-09T12:56:10Z

This release is to fix the sync lock issues on devices that have an incorrect clock. Specifically, it should fix this error: "Cannot acquire sync lock: either the lock could be written but not read back. Or it was expired before it was read again".

## [v1.0.242](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/tag/v1.0.242) - 2020-09-04T22:00:34Z

- Fixes sync target upgrade issue when custom TLS settings are used

## [v1.0.241](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/tag/v1.0.241) - 2020-09-04T18:06:00Z

This release will ask you to upgrade your sync target and, once it is done, only the latest clients will be able to sync with this sync target. So please make sure you upgrade your other clients too (mobile, cli, etc.).

This version also includes an update to the search engine and as a result starting the app the first might be SLOW, as the search engine indexes all your notes. It might take from a few seconds to several minutes depending on how large your note collection is. This is a one off operation.

## [v1.0.216](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/releases/tag/v1.0.216) - 2020-05-24T14:21:01Z

This release includes a rewrite of the note editor component in order to allow further improvements (which were no longer possible) and to make it easier to maintain both WYSIWYG editors and regular editor.

A new button "Code View" has been added to switch between the WYSIWYG editor and the Markdown editor.

The note-specific toolbar has also been moved next to the title field for now because it wasn't practical to leave it with the editor-specific toolbar (and also not logical). It might be tweaked or moved later on once we have a clearer idea of what we want to do.

Finally, the tag bar has been moved to the top of the note editor pane. Again this was in part necessary after the refactoring, but also more logical since the tags are relevant to the note, but not to the note content. So it makes more sense to have the editor toolbar right next to the editor content, without the tag bar in between, as before.

Still more fixes and improvements to get v1 as stable as possible before adding new features.

IMPORTANT: If you use Nextcloud it is recommended to sync all your notes before installing this release (see below).

- Fixed: Nextcloud sync target ID (which was incorrectly set to WebDAV sync ID). As a result items that have been created since this bug will be re-synced with Nextcloud. This sync will not duplicate or delete any item but is necessary to preserve data integrity. IF YOU HAVE NOTES IN CONFLICT AFTER SYNC: Close the app completely and restart it to make sure all the lists are visually up-to-date. The notes in conflict most likely can be ignored - they are just duplicate of the real ones. To be safe, check the content but most likely they can simply be deleted.

- Fixed: Allow copy and paste from config and encryption screen on macOS
- Fixed: [#201](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/201), [#216](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues/216): Make sure only one update check can run at a time, and improved modal dialog boxes
