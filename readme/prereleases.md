# Getting pre-releases

Pre-releases are available for the desktop application. They are pretty much like regular releases, except that they have not yet been tested by many users, so it is possible that a bug or two went through.

You can help the development of Joplin by choosing to receive these early releases when updating the application. If you find any bug or other issue, you may report it [on the forum](https://discourse.joplin.cozic.net/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/issues).

In general it is safe to use these pre-releases (they do not include any experimental or unstable features). In fact most pre-release eventually become regular releases after a few days.

To have access to these pre-releases, simply go to **Configuration screen** and tick the box "**Also get pre-releases when checking for updates**".
