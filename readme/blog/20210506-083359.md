# Joplin has been granted 6 project slots for GSoC 2021

Google has announced the project slots for GSoC 2021 and granted us 6 this year. That's a big step up from our first GSoC last year when we got 2!

In the coming weeks we will be reviewing the student applications again and select the 6 candidates as well as mentors. By the way if you might be interested in co-mentoring a project, feel free to let me know (More info in [this post](https://www.patreon.com/posts/call-for-google-50662125)).
