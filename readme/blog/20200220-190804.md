# GSoC 2020: Joplin has been accepted as a mentor organization!

Good news, our Google Summer of Code 2020 application [has been accepted](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/?sp-search=joplin#6258880889225216)!

Since we made the announcement back in November, we already had a few students submitted pull requests and getting themselves familiar with the codebase.

We hope some of them will work on [the project ideas](https://joplinapp.org/gsoc2020/ideas.html) we've suggested, and develop some great features this summer!
