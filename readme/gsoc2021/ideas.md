## 6. Plugin system on mobile

The plugin system is currently available on desktop and CLI. We believe it could work on mobile too although some work will have to be done to make the plugin API compatible, as well as add a mechanism to load plugins.

Difficulty Level: High

Skills Required: JavaScript, React Native

## 7. Conflict resolution editor plugin

When a note is modified on two different devices, a "conflict note" is generated. It would be useful to create a plugin that allows taking this "conflict note" and the current version of the note, and compare them using a colored diff editor. It could be a built-in editor, or perhaps the plugin could leverage existing diff editors and feed the note versions to it.

Expected Outcome: Allow resolving note conflicts using a merge editor

Difficulty Level: High

Skills Required: JavaScript, Markdown, Understanding of diff and merging conflicts

Potential Mentor(s): Tessus
