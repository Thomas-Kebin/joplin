# Tips

The first few notes should have given you an overview of the main functionalities in Joplin, but there's more it can do. See below for some of these features and how to get more help using the app:

## Web clipper

**TODO: add image**

The Web Clipper is a browser extension that allows you to save web pages and screenshots from your browser. To start using it, open the Joplin desktop application, go to the Web Clipper Options and follow the instructions.

More info on the official website: https://joplin.cozic.net/clipper

## Attachments

Any kind of file can be attached to a note. In Markdown, links to these files are represented as a simple ID to the resource. In the note viewer, these files, if they are images, will be displayed or, if they are other files (PDF, text files, etc.) they will be displayed as links. Clicking on this link will open the file in the default application.

Images can be attached either by clicking on "Attach file" or by pasting (with Ctrl+V) an image directly in the editor, or by drag and dropping an image.

## Search

Joplin supports advanced search queries, which are fully documented on the official website: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin#searching

## Alarms

An alarm can be associated with any to-do. It will be triggered at the given time by displaying a notification. To use this feature, see the documentation: https://github.com/laurent22/joplin#notifications

## Other Joplin applications

Besides the desktop application, Joplin is also available as a terminal application and as a mobile application. Both these apps can sync between them and with the desktop app.

## Donations

Donations to Joplin support the development of the project. Developing quality applications mostly takes time, but there are also some expenses, such as digital certificates to sign the applications, app store fees, hosting, etc. Most of all, your donation will make it possible to keep up the current development standard.

Please see the [donation page](https://joplin.cozic.net/donate/) for information on how to support the development of Joplin.
