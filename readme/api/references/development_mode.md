# Development mode

When experimenting with Joplin, for example when developing a plugin or trying a theme, you might want to run Joplin in development mode. Doing so means that Joplin will run using a different profile, so you can experiment without risking to accidentally change or delete your data.

To enable Development Mode, open Joplin as normal, then go to **Help => Copy dev mode command to clipboard**. This will copy a command to the clipboard. Now close Joplin, and start it again in dev mode using the command you've just copied.
