# FAQ

## What is Joplin Cloud?

Joplin supports various ways to synchronise data with cloud file hosting services. It does that in a generic way, which allows it to support many providers. However there are limits to what can be done in such a generic way - for example, certain performance optimisations are not possible, and more advanced features such as the ability to publish notes or share notebooks cannot be implemented.

This is where Joplin Cloud comes into place. It is a solution developed specifically for Joplin and as such offers various improvements, such as improved synchronisation performances, support for publishing notes, and sharing and collaborating on notebooks.

Moreover, by getting a subscription you are supporting the development of the project as a whole, including the open source applications. Such support helps in the long term to provide bug and security fixes, add new features, and provide support.

## What if I exceed the storage space?

If you exceed the storage space, you will not be able to upload new notes. You may however delete notes and attachments so as to free up space. If you are on a Basic plan, you may also upgrade to Pro. If you are on a Pro or Business plan please contact us and let us know that you need more space and we will increase your storage space.
